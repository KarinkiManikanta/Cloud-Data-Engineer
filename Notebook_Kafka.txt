Data Transfer Considerations:
* Security
* Reliability
* Speed
* availability
* Scalability

Security:-security means protecting digital data, such as those in a database, from destructive forces and from the unwanted actions of unauthorized users, 
		  such as a cyberattack or a data breach.
		  
Reliability:- Reliability means that data is complete and accurate, and it is a crucial foundation for building data trust across the organization.

Speed:- If transfer the huge amount of the data that time speed will required to transfer data in very fast and secure.

Avaliability:- availability is a term used by computer storage manufacturers and storage service providers to describe how data should be available at a 
			   ranging equired level of performance in situations ranging from normal through disastrous.
			   
Scalability:- The system can easily be expanded by adding more machines as needed.
